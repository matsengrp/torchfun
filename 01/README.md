## Minimal [pdbpp](https://github.com/pdbpp/pdbpp):

* `sticky`
* `n`: imagine we are going to the _next_ door
* `s`: we are _stepping_ inside
* `c`: _continue_ normal execution
* `u`: go up one level in the stack trace

You can enter arbitrary Python code, but if you run into a snag with that there is always `interact`.


## Possible next steps

* [PyTorch tutorial](https://github.com/sotte/pytorch_tutorial)
* [Pyro](https://pyro.ai/), a universal probabilistic programming language built on PyTorch
